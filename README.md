## MMDraggableTagView used to show draggable tags in a view
In recent projects, I require a view to show some tags about some pictures or infomation. Therefore, I have to divide the draggabel tag view from these projects to share. 
 **[MMDraggableTagView](https://github.com/michaelin1208/MMDraggableTagView)**	

The current version is unfinished, and the view will update as the development of related projects. 

## Cocoapods

Install Cocoapods if need be.
```
$ gem install cocoapods
```

Add MMNumberScrollView in your Podfile.
```
use_frameworks!
pod 'MMDraggableTagView'
```

Then, run the following command.
```
$ pod install
```


## Introduction
The introduction will be added after the submission of the first stable version of it
